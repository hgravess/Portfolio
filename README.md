## Junior Data Scientist - EdgeMethods
## Manufacturing Process Optimisation
Working for a large scale manufactorer, I used time series data to diagnose the root cause of the breakdown in the line leading to a delay. I calculated summary statistics of the time series data, quantifying the statistical qualities of the curves. Using these summary statistics I then used multiple clustering algorithms, such as Kmeans, DBscan. Spectral Clustering and Affinity propagation, to group similar breakdowns together. When a group was formed the average metrics were calculated and could be used to indentify when and how the breakdown took place. 

## Time Series Regression Prediction (Early Detection)
For the same manufactorer, I used other time series curves to predict a regression output that would quantify the quality of the product produced. Before hand the quality of the product could only be measured after it was produced, meaning that any addition could only be implemented in future product creation. With the help of my model, I could detect if an addition needed to be made early in the production cycle thus the addition could be made in real time, saving the manufacturer time, money and resources. To complete this task I used Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor and Neural Networks such and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit).

Data Science Project

## Work experience Project
## Clatterbridge NHS England
Completed a Data Science research project for Clatterbridge Cancer Centre. A novel machine learning project called "Comparing GNN to traditional Machine Learning algorithms when predicting multiple outcomes in chemotherapy patients." 

Used SQL to extract and create a bespoke dataset from the Clatterbridge dataware house. Used Python to preprocess, clean and formulate the data for modelling. Used PyTorch and Sklearn to model the data in 6 different machine learning models. 3 traditional models LR, RF DNN, and 3 newly invented Graph Neural Network models of SGC (Simple Graph Convolution), GCN (Graph Convolution Networks) and GAT (Graph Attention Transformers). These modelled predicted Recurrence and Toxicity in cancer patients.
