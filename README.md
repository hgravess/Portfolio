Data Science Project

## Work experience Project
## Clatterbridge NHS England
Completed a Data Science research project for Clatterbridge Cancer Centre. A novel machine learning project called "Comparing GNN to traditional Machine Learning algorithms when predicting multiple outcomes in chemotherapy patients." 

Used SQL to extract and create a bespoke dataset from the Clatterbridge dataware house. Used Python to preprocess, clean and formulate the data for modelling. Used PyTorch and Sklearn to model the data in 6 different machine learning models. 3 traditional models LR, RF DNN, and 3 newly invented GNN models of SGC, GCN and GAT.

## Projects:
### Survival Analysis of the Mimic-iv Dataset - BSc Project

Surivial Analysis through Classical statistical Methods of Cox regression and Machine learning Methods of Random Survival Forests and Gradient Boosting Machine, using the public Medical Dataset MIMIC-IV.

### Activity Time Series Classification Using Deep Learning Models

Classification of Time series Data using a variety of Machine Learning Algorithms such as Random Forests, CNN, LTSM and GRU

### Sentiment Analysis of YouTube Music Videos using Real Time Data Streaming

Sentiment Analysis of YouTube Comments of the UK top 40 music Videos, real time data streaming and classification using Random Forests.

### Data Analysis and Visualisation

Data Analysis and Visualisation and 4 different datasets from the machine learning repository
